FITS image files from the TGSS and NVSS surveys. fits_functions relies on clusterer.py, for which details can be found in Devin's git repository [Moon-Shaped-Pool](https://github.com/dcunningham725/Moon-Shaped-Pool). fits_functions has a module containing functions and a jupyter notebook which explains these how these functions can be used.
