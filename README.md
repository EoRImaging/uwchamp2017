# uwchamp2017

Git repository for Summer 2017 project on extended radio source modeling with MWA data that has been deconvolved using FHD. See Devin's repository [Moon-Shaped-Pool](https://github.com/dcunningham725/Moon-Shaped-Pool) for his contributions, including algorithms for clustering the components of extended objects. This repo contains functions for plotting individual extended objects, downloading FITS image files of extended objects from different surveys, and plotting the contours of extended objects as seen by MWA over FITS image files of the same object.
